# grafanacloud Provider

A Terraform provider for managing Grafana Cloud resources.

## Use Cases

A few possible use-cases are:

- Managing API keys for both Grafana Cloud and Grafana instances inside stacks
- Revoking API keys by tainting TF resources
- Collecting information about configured Stacks, such as Prometheus / Alertmanager endpoints
- Reading Grafana data sources


## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "grafanacloud" {
  # You may provide the API key safely through Terraform Cloud, or alternatively
  # provide it as GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_KEY when running `terraform`.
  api_key        = var.your_secret_api_key
  organisation = "org-slug"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **organisation** (String) Organisation which the API key belongs to (as slug name).

### Optional

- **api_key** (String, Sensitive) API key used to authenticate with the API. Must have `Admin` role if API keys need to be managed. Might also be provided via `GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_KEY`.
- **url** (String) Grafana Cloud API endpoint including the final `/api`. Usually there's no need to change this.
